                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Neem plant, also known as Azadirachta indica, is renowned for its numerous health and environmental benefits. Its leaves, bark, seeds, and oil contain potent antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties, making it a natural remedy for skin disorders, infections, and inflammation. Neem oil is widely used in cosmetics for treating acne, scars, and eczema due to its ability to cleanse and soothe the skin. The plant’s extracts are also used in traditional medicine to boost immunity, regulate blood sugar levels, and aid in digestion. Additionally, Neem is effective in pest control, serving as a natural insecticide that helps in sustainable agriculture.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Neem is a resilient, evergreen tree that flourishes year-round, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. It can endure dry conditions and is drought-resistant, making it suitable for hot, arid seasons when many other plants struggle. Neem typically flowers between January and May, depending on the region, producing small, fragrant white flowers. The fruiting season generally occurs between May and August, providing seeds from which Neem oil is extracted. Its hardy nature allows it to remain lush and productive, even during the harshest summers.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to the Indian subcontinent, Neem thrives across various parts of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to regions in Africa, the Middle East, and even parts of the Caribbean and South America, where similar climate conditions exist. Neem grows best in areas with temperatures between 21–32°C (70–90°F), and it can be found in rural, semi-arid, and urban landscapes across these regions. Its high tolerance to poor soils and dry climates makes it especially valuable in areas prone to drought.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> Neem is a long-lived tree, with a lifespan that can range from 150 to 200 years under favorable conditions. It matures slowly, reaching full height after about 10 years, and can grow up to 20–25 meters (65–82 feet) tall. As it matures, its bark thickens and develops a deep brown hue, with large, spreading branches that create a dense canopy. Neem’s longevity and resilience are attributed to its robust root system and adaptive properties, allowing it to withstand harsh environmental conditions for generations.</p>
